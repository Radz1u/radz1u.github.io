The hardest thing is to start the journey. There is a moment in every programmer's life when they consider creating their own place in the network. Why? What will he change in the Internet, where there is more junk than content? I always asked myself a question, but now I realize that all this is not important.  I am a techno enthusiast with a strong polarity to cloud technologies and my website will not change exactly anything on the Internet, but it will be great for stagnation.  If you are looking for the latest news, innovative ideas and other hi-tech stuff, I highly recommend checking other sources, this is just another programmer's blog :D Hmmm... Did I mention, I like to use irony? I would like to treat this blog as a place to document my thoughts and decisions, maybe even ideas that can inspire someone to do something with their life/ time/ money.... so much money, because sometimes spending time on some inspiration can cost a little... 

So much for the first post. Stay tuned!
